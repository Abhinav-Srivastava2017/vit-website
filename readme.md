Remake of vit university official webpage following hci principles
HCI project

This is my course's official project. I tried to develop a better designed and usable version of the official website of my college VIT University, Vellore. 
There are two pages that are working - home and postgraduate page.
I implemented Bootstrap 4 framework for design and simple html and css. Pretty static webpage.

Simple. Minimal. Fast. Efficient.
